#Login Text
Shows some text as Title on joining any server

##Can be configured via file "./minecraft/config/logintext.properties".
Use "customtext=" to set what u want, "%nickname%" will be replaced with ur nickname, "%heart%" will be replaced to "❤",
use "%color%" + number to change color.
Example: "customtext=%color%6%nickname% is cool %heart%" will show "HiWord9 is cool ❤" colored as orange.
Use "enabled=false" to turn mod off.

##Works on >=1.20.1, mod itself has no limits on which version of minecraft to use it, so i think it should work on newer versions but im not sure.
